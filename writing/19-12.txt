Task 2

It is true that some people think that the main way to be happy is to have a lot of money.
In my opinion money can provide a financial security, good opportunities and a healthy life.
With a lot of money we know that financial security, the basics needs and comfort won't be a problem,
the access to houses, food, education and health promote a life without less stress. The possibility
to chose a work which you like, our be our own boss, have a opportunities to travel and live where you want,
spend more time taking caring of your health, doing physical exercises seeing the doctor, and a good nutrition,
all this things will be promote happiness, a life without worries allowing individuals to focus on others
questions of their life.
It is not just money provides happiness, others factors contributing to happiness too. Relationships,
family and values are also important, the human being likes to have a social life, positives relationships,
a great love can impact happiness.News experiences also can provide happiness, the life does not bee the
same routine.
In conclusion, it must be extremely difficult live without money or sources of income.I see money makes
huge difference in life, providing every basics things but it is not all, you can find happiness
in others parts of live like relationships, family and values.
